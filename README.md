# Dynamic Merkle Tree

## Introduction
The idea of this project is to implement an example of a dynamic merkle tree implemented in Solidity. The goal is to satisfy the following requirements:
- The tree leaves are not stored on chain
- Anyone with tree leaves from an untrusted source can check with a single call if the tree contains the leaves

## Implementation
The implementation is definitely not optimized or gas efficient at the moment. It's just for demonstration.
